# AI & ML made functional
Create AI/ML systems in the cloud through Azure Notebooks, F# & .NET Core with DevOps environments 


FAQ
===================


Why use F# for data science projects?
===================

F# is an excellent programming language that is functional first. It's well-suited for data science projects due to the following: 
* Efficient execution
* Concisness
* Strict type system
* Data access capabilities
* Scalability

In time, F# has shown how powerful a tool it is and now Microsoft is investing more efforts and time to showcase that it's an excellent tool for machine learning.

"Finally, we're also devoting significant time in developing a compelling offering for using F# to do machine learning. In addition to being supported on ML.NET, we're working towards a world-class experience when using F# and TensorFlow," Microsoft said.
