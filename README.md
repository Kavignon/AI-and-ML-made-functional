# AI & ML made functional
Create AI/ML systems in the cloud through Azure Notebooks, F# & .NET Core with DevOps environments 


FAQ
===================


Why use F# for data science projects?
===================

F# is an excellent programming language that is functional first. It's well-suited for data science projects due to the following: 
* Efficient execution
* Concisness
* Strict type system
* Data access capabilities
* Scalability

In time, F# has shown how powerful a tool it is and now Microsoft is investing more efforts and time to showcase that it's an excellent tool for machine learning.

"Finally, we're also devoting significant time in developing a compelling offering for using F# to do machine learning. In addition to being supported on ML.NET, we're working towards a world-class experience when using F# and TensorFlow," Microsoft said. 

What is the scope of the repository?
===================

The scope of the repository is quite big. It was created for both beginners and intermediate in the following categories:

* Machine Learning
* Functional Programming
* DevOps

The purpose of the repository is to see machine learning from a different kind of lenses. Using skills that some may already have by using the .NET framework (or .NET Core), you will come to get to know enough of data science space such as:

* Feature engineering
* Data normalization
* Setuping your environment
* Using a Jupyter Notebook
* Evaluating your model
* Train your model


What kind of projects can be consulted in the repository?
===================

The repository will use old and current machine learning competitions that are found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). For those who don't know what Kaggle is, in a few words, it is the world's largest community of data scientists. It provides you courses on data science and the chance to compete on machine learning project either for the sake of putting your skills to the test or to get on the podium and win big cash prizes.

Also, you'll also be able to find machine learning notes on courses that I will take online with resources such as [Coursera](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=coursera) or [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). The vast majority of the courses should be with Python, but I'll make sure, to the best of my abilities, to refactor the code samples to showcase only F#.
